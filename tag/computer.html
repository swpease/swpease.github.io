</footer><!-- /.post-info --><h1>Background</h1>
<p>Gunicorn provides <a href="http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/deploy.html">a number of ways</a> for you to handle running it in deployment. You need a supervisor, which is just a process that monitors and manages some other process. So you can tell it things like, 'start gunicorn when someone first requests a webpage' and 'reload gunicorn when it crashes'.</p>
<p>In skimming over the options that Gunicorn listed, I initially thought of using Supervisor, probably because I had seen it mentioned before. I am wary of my disposition to trusting things just because I've heard of them, but decided to look into it anyway. I saw that I would need to install Python 2 to use it, and put my foot down.
I decided to try out systemd because it was a built-in tool, and I am suspicious of taking on dependencies for what seem to be minimal tasks. It also seemed the most generalizable thing to learn.</p>
<h1>Research</h1>
<p>The best basic introduction I found was on <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-systemd-units-and-unit-files#anatomy-of-a-unit-file">Digital Ocean</a>.
The systemd creators have their documentation as well: <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html#">systemd</a>, <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemctl.html">systemctl</a>.
More advanced topics, such as security and setting up your own software to handle systemd socket stuff, are covered in this dude Pid Eins's <a href="http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/security.html">blog</a>, though it's not spectacularly organized.
For implementing systemd for Gunicorn, I referenced mostly <a href="http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/deploy.html">Gunicorn</a>, but also <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-django-with-postgres-nginx-and-gunicorn-on-ubuntu-16-04#create-a-gunicorn-systemd-service-file">Digital Ocean</a>.
I might need a systemd service file for <a href="https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/initscripts/">nginx</a>.</p>
<h1>Execution</h1>
<p>Gunicorn recommends setting up a socket, which is always listening, which starts up Gunicorn proper via a corresponding "service". Per Eins's blog, this can be a more efficient way to use resources. For instance, if you have a bunch of rarely-accessed websites on the same server, you could activate / deactivate them as needed. I wonder if this is how Heroku manages its hobby-tier apps.</p>
<p>The gunicorn.socket file is super simple:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">[Unit]</span>
<span class="na">Description</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">gunicorn socket</span>

<span class="k">[Socket]</span>
<span class="na">ListenStream</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">/run/gunicorn/socket</span>

<span class="k">[Install]</span>
<span class="na">WantedBy</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">sockets.target</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>It basically specifies an address to listen on for a stream socket. systemd appears to create this socket as part of this gunicorn.socket file's existence -- this socket is the only contents of /run/gunicorn when you navigate to it upon starting up the server.</p>
<p>The gunicorn.service is a bit more complex:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">[Unit]</span>
<span class="na">Description</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">gunicorn daemon</span>
<span class="na">Requires</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">gunicorn.socket</span>
<span class="na">After</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">network.target</span>

<span class="k">[Service]</span>
<span class="na">PIDFile</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">/run/gunicorn/pid</span>
<span class="na">User</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">vagrant</span>
<span class="na">Group</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">www-data</span>
<span class="na">RuntimeDirectory</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">gunicorn</span>
<span class="na">WorkingDirectory</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">/vagrant/mysite</span>
<span class="na">ExecStart</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">/home/vagrant/.local/share/virtualenvs/vagrant-gKDsaKU3/bin/gunicorn --pid /run/gunicorn/pid --bind unix:/run/gunicorn/socket mysite.wsgi</span>
<span class="na">ExecReload</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">/bin/kill -s HUP $MAINPID</span>
<span class="na">ExecStop</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">/bin/kill -s TERM $MAINPID</span>
<span class="na">PrivateTmp</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">true</span>

<span class="k">[Install]</span>
<span class="na">WantedBy</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">multi-user.target</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is more complex. An annotation (NB: I do not know what all of these mean) goes something like:</p>
<p><code>Requires=gunicorn.socket</code> says that gunicorn.service is dependent upon gunicorn.socket.</p>
<p><code>PIDFile=/run/gunicorn/pid</code> I'm unsure why Gunicorn's docs have this in here. Look at the systemd docs for more info on it.</p>
<p><code>User</code> and <code>Group</code> per Digital Ocean,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We will give our regular user account ownership of the process since it owns all of the relevant files. We'll give group ownership to the www-data group so that Nginx can communicate easily with Gunicorn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am still a bit unclear about what user and group will be needed. I tried setting both <code>User</code> and <code>Group</code> to be "vagrant", and tried both as "www-data", and both yield responses when connecting to the index page on localhost.</p>
<p><code>RuntimeDirectory=gunicorn</code> The <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.exec.html#">docs</a> indicate that the directory's lifetime will be bound to the daemon's. Upon running <code>sudo systemctl stop gunicorn.service</code>, which calls the <code>ExecStop</code> command, /run/gunicorn is empty, i.e. the socket is gone. It looks like this declaration supersedes the Gunicorn docs's suggestion of having /etc/tmpfiles.d/gunicorn.conf (systemd says tmpfiles.d is for complex cases).
Removing this line yields the following error when trying to connect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>curl: (56) Recv failure: Connection reset by peer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it appears that /run/gunicorn and its parent dirs are owned by root with permissions 755. Conversely, when RuntimeDirectory is specified, /run/gunicorn has User and Group equal to what they were specified as in the gunicorn.service file (vagrant and www-data in this case).
When the service has been halted, then, per RuntimeDirectory's behavior, /run/gunicorn will be deleted. As such, to restart things, you need to restart gunicorn.socket with <code>sudo systemctl restart gunicorn.socket</code>. This will recreate the /run/gunicorn directory with the socket in it.</p>
<p><code>WorkingDirectory</code> sets the directory for any executed commands (e.g. ExecStart).</p>
<p><code>ExecStart</code> and company are just commands to execute at the relevant lifecycle events. For my purposes, because I have Gunicorn installed via a virtual environment, I have to provide the path to its actual install. I think I could alternatively use other lifecycle hooks to start and stop the virtual environment, the just call 'gunicorn' in my ExecStart.</p>
<p><code>PrivateTmp</code> is described as a security feature (see also Eins's blog)</p>
<h1>Problems I Encountered</h1>
<p>I made some edits to my gunicorn.service file, and I was not getting my curl test to work (<code>curl --unix-socket /run/gunicorn/socket http://localhost:8000</code> <em>mind the port</em>). Upon restarting the VM, it worked. I believe I needed to run <code>sudo systemctl daemon-restart</code>.</p>                </article>
