<p>I have had to shave regularly, since some time in high school. I have fairly thick hair, particularly in the chin and mustache region. It can be a hassle. I've tried a few options over the years:
1. Buying cartridges in stores.
2. Subscribing to online clubs.
3. Safety razors.</p>
<p>They each have their pros and cons, which I'll go over.</p>
<h3>Buying Cartridges in Stores</h3>
<p>The classic for anyone who isn't geriatric. I remember when my dad taught me to shave. It was basically, "spray some shaving cream into your hand, rub it over your face, then rub this razor over your face..." There's really nothing to it.</p>
<p>I like shaving with these the best. I have always been a fan on the two-bladed cartridges. Three is okay, but I dislike how bulky the larger-count cartridges are. I also feel like they're a complete waste, given how effective two blades have been for me.</p>
<p>The only issue for me is cost. I recently checked out the cartridges selection at Fred Meyer, and saw my trusty Sensor Excels at 10 for $30. That's just too much. This price is what drove me to try option #2 on the list.</p>
<h3>Subscribing to Online Clubs</h3>
<p>I tried out Dollar Shave Club. I went with the two-bladed model. At first I was pleased with it: it did the job well and cost a fraction of the price (I think ~ $1 / cartridge).</p>
<p>But then, I visited my parents, where I still have some of the classic cartridges (both Sensor Excel and Mach 3). It felt like heaven to my face in comparison.</p>
<p>If I had to guess, I'd say that the issue was the flimsy construction, which might cause some shaking / other motion that leads to uneven speeds across my face, leading to more tugging. But that's just conjecture.</p>
<p>Which led me to option #3 on the list.</p>
<h3>Safety Razors</h3>
<p>I performed a little research using some relevant subreddit. I forget the name. But I wound up going with Maggard for my razor, styptic, alum block, brush, a variety pack of blades, and 'sapone di barba' or whatever.</p>
<p>I've been using it for close to a year now, and my conclusion is: it's okay. I haven't been this nonplussed by a hyped alternative product since organic peanut butter.</p>
<p>I did learn why dads teaching their sons how to shave is actually a thing: there's a lot more going on with safety razor shaving compared to cartridge shaving. You gotta lather the shaving cream, angle the razor, be careful about the grain...</p>
<p>But, I still just prefer the ease and comfort of a Gillette cartridge and canned shaving cream. Sure, my <em>sapone</em> smells nice, but it's inconvenient and expensive. It is more common for me to miss spots with my safety razor as well, stemming from the fact that it's not as comfortable on my face. Plus I'm still trying to find my optimum razor blades, an area for which reviews aren't really much use, since other reviewers don't have your face.</p>
<p>That being said, the cartridge is not 10+ times the price better. So I'll stick with my safety razor.</p>                </article>
