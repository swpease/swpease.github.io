&lt;p&gt;Ever since moving out of the dorm in college, I have be plagued by a roommate who is a dish soaker. It's horrible! This essentially translates to that, aside from times when I have lived alone, there has been a dirty dish in the sink very nearly every single day of my life. There have been three primary offenders:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Roommate #1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This primarily constituted peanut-butter coated utensils. The strategy appeared to be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clean the spoon / knife that has been festering in the sink for the better part of a day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get out a new spoon / knife for peanut butter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place said utensil in the sink.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also yielded perpetual peanut butter spots on the bottom of the sink. The icing on the cake is that this roommate did not wash the peanut butter off the sponge, so there were globs of peanut butter left on it for me to clean off ðŸ¤¢.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, Roommate #1 was an incompetent dishwasher. They didn't seem to grasp the concept that dishes are three-dimensional objects. Further, they didn't seem to grasp that, by virtue of their dish soaking, they were paradoxically making their dishes dirtier. Take a frying pan for instance. The residual oil in the pan, when put into the sink, get distributed across some larger portion of the pan, most notably the bottom. This wouldn't be an issue if my roommate was aware of what was happening, but they didn't consider anything except the initially relevant portion worth running a sponge over, so the bottom of the pan wound up worse off after its "cleaning". A similar argument exists for the handles of the peanut butter utensils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dish soaking dirtification, which I always think of as a manifestation of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugacity_capacity"&gt;fugacity capacity&lt;/a&gt;, seems to be lost on dish soakers. Which brings me to...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Roommate #2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They had this big red bowl that they would use for virtually every meal. I would go so far as so say that the sink was where their bowl's storage spot. I can't remember it not ever being in there. The weakest offender of the trio, they were definitely cognizant of the three-dimensional nature of dishes. Plus I never used that bowl, so its cleanliness wasn't a huge deal to me. It just always kinda grossed me out to see that bowl getting covered in who knows what over the course of the day. So, last, but certainly not least...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Roommate #3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, a competent dish washer. The main issue I had with this dish soaker was that our faucet was leaky, and they somehow were not bothered by the sound of water drops splashing into a little pool. My room was on the second floor, so I would frequently have to go downstairs to the kitchen and move the faucet so that it wasn't over the bowl or pan that they were soaking. They knew I hated it and thought it was funny. The best revenge I could think of was to lay a plate in their favorite spot for cups in the dish washer; "It's like you do it on purpose!".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Utility of Soaking&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While my prior interlude during my rant on Roommate #1 covers the majority of my issue with dish soaking, I would like to add that I believe the desire to soak dishes comes from a typically greatly overestimated estimate as to how long a dish has to soak for it to become easy to wash. I have mostly left my dishes randomly dispersed on the counters / stove. I have never figured out if any of my roommates hated this strategy as much as I hate dish soaking. But, typically I am able to soak dishes in the time it takes me to do the dishes that don't require soaking. For instance, the pan with dried red sauce I'll put in the sink before doing some utensils or some such, and this brief soak gets me most of the way to where the three-hour soak would. That being said, there are definitely some dishes that require a long soak. Things like cheesy casserole dishes. I almost forgot, it is harder for someone else to do dishes when you are soaking your dishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that about covers my opinions on dish soaking.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="cooking"></category><category term="cleaning"></category></entry></feed>
